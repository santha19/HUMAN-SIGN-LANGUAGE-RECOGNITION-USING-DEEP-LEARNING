# ABSTRACT
Disability of deaf and dumb is one of the major significant problem in the human world. The development of technologies for recognition of deaf and dumb impaired peoples is done by several methodologies. So, We are developing this project using deep learning by recognizing the symbolic hand gestures of deaf and dumb impaired
peoples. Sign language is learned by deaf and dumb impaired people, and usually it is not known to normal people, so it becomes a challenge for communication between a normal person and deaf and dumb impaired person. The main focus of our project is to make predictions of hand gestures from deaf and dumb peoples. Our project recognizes different types of hand gestures as input and make predictions with accuracy level based on pre-trained dataset models by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Algorithm.

# INTRODUCTION

Communication of deaf and dumb impaired peoples is one of the major cause of gap between normal human beings and those impaired peoples. Lack of communication mostly involves with them and it leads less interactions with others. The development of technologies for bridging gap between these impaired peoples are done by several methodologies. The scope of this project is to make predictions with hand gestures and its recognition. The focus will be placed on designing a model of sign language recognition with trained datasets. Training a dataset is used by OpenCV and Region of Interest. We will train dataset using deep learning algorithms and make predictions by comparing with pre-trained datasets and with level of accuracy.

# Aim of the project
Our Aim of the project is to improve the communication of deaf and dumb people. In this manner, a system which can make predictions of hand gestures of deaf and
dumb people.
